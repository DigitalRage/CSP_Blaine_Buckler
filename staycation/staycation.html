        <p class="oxanium"><span class="format">Fishing</span><br> When it comes to trout or catfish, Moab has something for everyone. If you’re up for the challenge, head to the sandy beaches along the Colorado River, where catfish abound and anglers can test their skills. On the other hand, if you prefer the tranquility of beautiful lakes and streams, the nearby La Sal Mountains offer fantastic trout fishing opportunities.</p>
